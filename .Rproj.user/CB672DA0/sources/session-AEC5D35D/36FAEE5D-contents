## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(forecast)
library(tseries)
library(urca)
library(TSstudio)
library(xts)
load("scenario_1data.RData")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
head(scen1_sample)
tail(scen1_sample)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r }
ggplot(data = scen1_sample, mapping = aes(x = WeekDay, y = `scen1_dem_node_ 2`,)) + 
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = "tomato")

```

Stationarity 

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r }
adf.test(scen1_sample$scen1_flow_link_1)
```


```{r repDset}
repDsetScen1 <- subset(scenario_1, select = c(`scen1_dem_node_ 4`, `scen1_dem_node_ 5`, `scen1_dem_node_ 4`))



```




```{r plo}
repDsetScen1 <- ts(repDsetScen1, start = 2017, frequency = 17520)

```
