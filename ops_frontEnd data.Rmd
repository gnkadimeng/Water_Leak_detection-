```

## Purpose 

The purpose of this document is to share and describe the data that we have to display for the operator from the operational perspective. 

```{r desc}
library(epanetReader)
library(tidyr)
n1 <- read.inp("~/Projects/LeakDB/CCWI-WDSA2018/Benchmarks/Hanoi_CMH/Scenario-1/Hanoi_CMH_Scenario-1.inp")
```

## Pipeline layout 

The pipeline layout is consistent across all the operationg scenarios. 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(n1)
```

Elements of the pipeline

```{r summary}
names(n1)
```
Junctions
Pipes metadata we need to display 
```{r pipes}
n1[2:7]
```
